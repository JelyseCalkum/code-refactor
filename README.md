##  Summary

This project was to take existing code and refactor it to meet accessibility requirements and ensure that the landing page is optimized for search engines.

## Description of Application

I was given the task of improving the codebase for Horiseon. The criteria included ensuring the website's title is both clear and descriptive, implementing semantic HTML elements properly, structuring HTML elements logically, including accessible alt attributes for image elements, arranging heading attributes in sequential order, and optimizing the landing page for search engines and adhering to accessibility standards as requested by the client.


## Acceptance Criteria

As part of my work, I optimized the website title, repaired broken internal links, restructured HTML using semantic elements, removed unnecessary CSS classes, consolidated CSS selectors and properties to reduce redundancy, reordered CSS to match the HTML structure, added alt attributes to images, and applied the DRY principle to enhance the codebase's long-term sustainability.
